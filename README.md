# Theater-Ticket-Bokking-Java-App
This is a java application which can use for seat reservation for movie in theater. It was created under server client programme. It was created for an mini assessment. So for the simplicity here i have created hash table instead of a database. So hash tables can be replaced by data bases and suitable queries.


Prolems / bugs:-
1. It's not resizable.
2. It can run simultanously multiple users. But not updating the data on working times. But when
  hit submit button, It will send the data. (So only when hit submit button only it will send the booked
  data. If hit submit button then it will hide booked seats. when someone check the seats it not hide 
  the seats for other users.)
